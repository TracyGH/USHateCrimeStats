> NOTE: 2021 statistics are incomplete due to a shift from the Summary Reporting System (SRS) to the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). As a result of the change to NIBRS-only data collection starting in 2021, law enforcement agency participation in submitting all crime statistics, including hate crimes, fell significantly from 2020 to 2021. 


In the last 30 years, Blacks and African Americans have been targeted for bias-motivated crimes 270% more than any other group in the US.
